# FFT-HW
Hardware FFT project for school.

FFT hardware implementation for FPGA using VHDL. This is a school project for the french Grande Ã‰cole IMT Atlantique in Brest, France. 

The file [a relative link](Conception_d_architecture_numeriques.pdf) contains the explanation of the architecture chosen and the different decisions made in order to implement a performant FFT in hardware.
